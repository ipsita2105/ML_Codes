Input is normalized and 20% is selected as testing data

// Choosing the model

model_selection.py

compares cross validation error among the following models-

* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso
* Elastic Net
* Polynomial Fit (was almost same for degree 2 & 3)
* RBF Fit

Value of K for KFold validation = 10

Resultant values are -

Model,  negative mean squared error,    Standard Deviation

Linear Regression CVE =  -6.43980802956 , 0.726734867434
Ridge Regression CVE =  -6.90758749264 , 0.742428881445
Lasso Regression CVE =  -7.24672982243 , 0.746930590441
Elastic Net CVE =  -7.24672982243 , 0.746930590441
Poly CVE =  -6.77532784063 , 0.757965967841
RBF CVE =  -6.77062996204 , 0.764299754487

From the obtained values we can conclude that
Linear Regression performs best among them.

The file also plots the corrleation heat map among 
the data features.

// Training the model

Therefore the file model_train.py
trains linear regression model on given data.

On testing following values are obtained-

Coefficients:
 [[-0.00552171 -0.00140924  0.01721326 -0.02248526  0.02039384]]

Mean squared error: 5.70

Correlation: 0.56300721

Variance score: 0.31

// Testing model

This code takes input file - PDBbind2015_core.dat

And outputs the result obtained from this model.
